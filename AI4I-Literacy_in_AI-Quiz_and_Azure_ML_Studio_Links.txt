Machine Learning For Everyone Quiz

Machine learning finds patterns in existing data and applies the patterns to new data. Is this true or false?
True <-answer
False

What is a target variable?
The most important variable for predicting the output.
The variable that you do not have data for and still need to obtain.
The value that you are trying to predict. <-answer

Which type of machine learning is normally used for customer segmentation?
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning <-answer

What is a confusion matrix?
A way to evaluate classification models. <-answer
A way that computers use to create classification models.
An advanced way for computers to organize machine learning data.

What are hyperparameters?
Inputs to a machine learning algorithm that can be changed. <-answer
A type of classification model.

What is one disadvantage of deep learning?
It is difficult to explain how the AI arrives at its predictions. The model becomes a 'black box'. <-answer
It is less accurate.
It only works for a few types of machine learning problems.



AIET-3 Ethics Issues In Product and Model Design Quiz

Suppose we have evaluated an AI product to have a likely and severe negative impact when the model fails. What can we do to reduce negative impact caused by AI?
Introduce a human-out-of-the-loop model, ie. allow the AI full control over the decision-making process, with no easy human override.
Introduce a human-in-the-loop model, ie. require a human to make affirmative action on all decisions, with the AI making recommendations. <-answer
Make the model creation open-source.

Suppose we have evaluated an AI product which uses facial recognition to identify criminal fugitives. We believe that it is a very negative outcome if innocent civilians are being wrongly identified and taken into custody. Which of the following is true?
The negative impact of false positives is high, so we should lower the confidence needed to identify suspected fugitives.
The negative impact of false negatives is high, so we should lower the confidence needed to identify suspected fugitives.
The negative impact of false positives is high, so we should increase the confidence needed to identify suspected fugitives. <-answer
The negative impact of false negatives is high, so we should increase the confidence needed to identify suspected fugitives.



AIET-4 Ethics Issues in Data Collection and Access Quiz

What is the ethical concern when a dataset is not representative?
The model is more likely to be inaccurate.
The model is more likely to be less transparent because it is missing data.
The model is more likely to be unfair, performing poorly for under-represented user groups. <-answer
The model is likely to have more false negatives.

Which of the following is NOT a way to address the privacy and consent concerns of the people we collect data on?
De-identify data by masking and deleting information to make it difficult or impossible to re-identify the subjects of the data.
Give users the option to opt out of their data being used.
Test the data make sure it is fair to different user subgroups. <-answer
Restrict access to the data and take security measures to protect the data.



AIET-5 Ethics Issues in Model Evaluation Quiz

What is the main ethics issue that can be identified in the model evaluation process?
The issue of privacy: whether user data can lead to their re-identification.
The issue of accountability: whether AI engineers take responsibility for their role in the model evaluation.
The issue of fairness: whether different user subgroups are treated equitably or whether any of them are being disadvantaged. <-answer
The issue of consent: whether users give permission to the use of their data in the training of AI models.
